DESCRIPTION ABOUT THE PROJECT <br />

1. Currently leading a predictive analytics project using a Decision Tree Regressor to forecast taxi tips. <br />
2. Used a publicly available dataset sourced from the official NYC government website, containing comprehensive details on taxi tips collected by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission. <br />
3. Managing and analyzing the dataset, which is stored in Parquet format, efficiently accessing it with the PyArrow library. <br />
4. Focusing on predicting the 'tip_amount' variable, an essential target in each row representing individual taxi trips during September 2023. <br />
5. Conducting thorough data preprocessing, including eliminating cash-paid tips and outliers, optimizing the dataset for analysis. <br />
6. Employing feature engineering techniques to extract time-related features from date-time columns, enhancing predictive modeling. <br />
7. Utilizing one-hot encoding to transform categorical data into numerical format, essential for modeling using the Scikit-Learn library. <br />
8. Conducting model training and performance evaluation with both Scikit-Learn and SnapML libraries, comparing their efficiency and accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE) metrics.<br />
