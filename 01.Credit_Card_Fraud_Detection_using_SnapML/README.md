DESCRIPTION ABOUT THE PROJECT
Code_file.ipynb contain a full detailed coding file
I have created a machin learning classification model using SnapML's decision tee classifier and compared with sklearn's classifier. And checked the SnapML Decision tree model is 13 times faster than sklearn decision tree model. Becouse, SnapML library offers a CPU/GPU multy-threading. 
Led a comprehensive credit card fraud detection initiative utilizing advanced machine learning techniques. 
SnapML, a high-performance library from IBM, employing Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine models in Python. 
Analyzed a real dataset containing September 2013 credit card transactions by European cardholders, addressing inherent class imbalance challenges. 
Orchestrated data preprocessing steps, including standardization, normalization, and strategic splitting of data into training and test sets. 
Expertly managed imbalanced class distributions using computed sample weights and specialized techniques. 
Conducted comparative analysis between scikit learn and SnapML libraries, measuring model performance and execution times for informed decision-making. 
Achieved proficiency in handling complex datasets, model training, and evaluation, contributing to a robust fraud detection system.
